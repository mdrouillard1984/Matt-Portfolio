# Thermal Mapping of TX & LA

This is a project I worked on as the capstone to my Master's which highlights key areas in TX & LA which would be suitable for enhanced (or "unconventional) geothermal energy extraction. There is quite a bit of information here: I do hope you take the time to review it.
