# GIS Modeling

This is a project I and a classmate created using ArcGIS Pro Modeler workflow to find suitable O&G acreage to purchase in New Mexico for an imaginery oil company. The idea was to flush out the proper acreage using key metrics such as proximity to suitable water sources (for fracing), historical wildfire events (so the land wasn't high risk of fires), as well as the slope of the property (less land slope = easier to set drill rig).
