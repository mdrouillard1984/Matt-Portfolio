# GIS Modeling

This is a project myslef and a classmate created using ArcGIS Pro Modeler workflow to find suitable O&G acreage to purchase in New Mexico for an imaginery oil company. The idea was to flush out the proper acreage using key metrics such as proximity to suitable water sources (for fracing), historical wildfire events, as well as the slope of the property.
